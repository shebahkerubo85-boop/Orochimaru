## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Sanin does not host, provide, distribute, or link to any copyrighted content.**  

The app is a **player and tracker** — nothing more. All streaming sources come from **third-party extensions** that users choose to install. These extensions are separate APK packages developed and maintained by the community, not by the Sanin team. The app connects exclusively to the official **[AniList](https://anilist.co)** and **[MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net)** APIs for tracking and syncing purposes.

**You are responsible for what you install and watch.**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 0. Get Sanin on Your TV

**Option A — Download directly on the TV (easiest)**
1. Open the browser app on your TV
2. Go to **`https://github.com/Shippun/sanin/releases/latest`**
3. Download the latest `app-google-arm64-v8a-release.apk`
4. Open the download — the system package installer will handle it
5. If the installer says **"Install blocked"**, go to TV Settings → Security → toggle **"Install unknown apps"** for your browser app

**Option B — Send from phone**
1. Download the APK on your phone from the same link above
2. Send it to your TV using:
   - **[LocalSend](https://localsend.org)** — works on most TVs, no cable needed
   - **ADB** — `adb connect TV_IP && adb install app-google-arm64-v8a-release.apk`
3. Install via the package installer

**Option C — App stores**
Sanin may be listed in third-party stores like **Downloader** or **Aptoide TV**. Search `"Sanin"` — but always prefer the GitHub release for the latest version.

> **Android requirement:** version 5.0+ (API 21). Works on **Nvidia Shield** (all generations), **Fire TV** (Stick, Cube, Omni), **Google TV** (Chromecast, Sony, TCL, Hisense), **Mi Box**, and any Android TV box. Also works on phones/tablets — no touchscreen required, full D-pad navigation built-in.

**Does NOT support Samsung TVs** — they run Tizen, not Android TV. No Android APK can install on them.

### 1. Sign In
Connect your **AniList** or **MyAnimeList** account to sync your watchlist, track progress, and get recommendations.

### 2. Add Extensions (Sources)

Sanin uses a **Tachiyomi-compatible extension system**. Extensions are separate APK packages that add streaming sources — without them, there's nothing to watch.

**Finding repos (on your TV or phone):**

1. Open a **browser** (on TV or phone)
2. Search `"wotaku wiki"` (highly preferred) or `"anime extensions"`
3. Find a repository URL on the page

**Adding the repo to Sanin:**

| Your Setup | How To |
|------------|--------|
| **TV has a clipboard ** | Copy the repo URL from the browser → switch to Sanin → **Settings → Extensions** → tap **`+`** → paste the URL |
| **No TV clipboard** | **Direct install is encouraged** — the wiki page lists extensions with an "Open" button. Tap it → Sanin opens directly → the extension installs without typing anything. |
| **Using your phone** | Find the repo URL on your phone → **LocalSend** / **ADB** aren't needed for repos — just note the URL and type it on TV (short form works: `username/repo/branch`) |or install a Bluetooth keyboard app/wifi

Once added, available extensions appear in the **Available** tab. Tap **Install** on any extension.

Switch to the **Installed** tab to manage, reorder, or update.

**Pro tips:**
- Use the **language filter** to narrow down sources
- Enable **NSFW extensions** in Settings → Extensions if needed
- Try a **different DNS** (Settings → Common → DNS) if sources won't load
- Use a **VPN** if your ISP throttles streaming traffic

### 3. Watch
Search or browse for an anime, tap an episode, and pick a source. Playback starts immediately with full gesture and D-pad controls.

## 🏗️ How It Works

```
User taps episode
       ↓
AnimeSources picks an installed extension
       ↓
AniyomiAdapter bridges the Tachiyomi AnimeSource API
       ↓
Extension fetches video URLs from its source website
       ↓
ExoPlayer plays the video
       ↓
AniList/MAL API updates your progress automatically
```

**Key architecture:**
- **Extensions** are standalone APKs that implement the `AnimeSource` interface (search, episode list, video extraction)
- **Sanin never proxies or caches video content** — it plays directly from URLs the extension provides
- **Tracking** happens through official GraphQL/REST APIs (AniList + MAL)
- **TV support** is baked in at the layout level — every XML has `focusable`, `nextFocus*` attributes, and `FocusEffectUtil` handles visual feedback

---

## 🖥️ Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shippun/sanin.git
cd sanin
./gradlew assembleGoogleRelease
```

APKs land in `app/build/outputs/apk/google/release/` — both `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`.

**Requirements:**
- JDK 21
- Android SDK 36
- Gradle 9.4+
